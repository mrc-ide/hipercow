\usage{
hipercow_hello(
  progress = NULL,
  timeout = NULL,
  driver = NULL,
  platform = "windows"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{progress}{Logical value, indicating if a progress spinner
should be used. The default \code{NULL} uses the option
\code{hipercow.progress}, and if unset displays a progress bar in an
interactive session.}

\item{timeout}{The time to wait for the task to complete. The
default is to wait forever.}

\item{driver}{The driver to use to send the test task.  This can
be omitted where you have exactly one driver, but we error if
not given when you have more than one driver, or if you have not
configured any drivers.}

\item{platform}{If the driver can target nodes running different
operating systems, then we can run hello world targeting that
platform. The default is \code{windows}, and \code{linux} can also be used
to test linux nodes connected to our MS-HPC cluster with the
hipercow.windows driver.}
}
\value{
The string "Moo", direct from your cluster.
