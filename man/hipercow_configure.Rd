\title{Configure your hipercow root}
\usage{
hipercow_configure(driver, ..., root = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{driver}{The hipercow driver; probably you want this to be
\code{"dide-windows"} as that is all we support at the moment!}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to your driver; see Details for
information about what is supported (this varies by driver).}

\item{root}{Hipercow root, usually best \code{NULL}}
}
\description{
Configure your hipercow root.  \code{hipercow_configure} creates the
configuration and \code{hipercow_configuration} looks it up
}
\section{Windows}{
Options supported by the \code{dide-windows} driver:
\itemize{
\item \code{shares}: Information about shares (additional to the one
mounted as your working directory) that should be made available
to the cluster job. The use case here is where you need access
to some files that are present on a shared drive and you will
access these by absolute path (say \verb{M:/gis/shapefiles/}) from
your tasks.  You can provide a share as a \code{windows_path} object,
or a list of such objects.  You will not typically need to use
this option.
\item \code{r_version}: Control the R version used on the
cluster. Typically hipercow will choose a version close to the
one you are using to submit jobs, of the set available on the
cluster. You can use this option to choose a specific version
(e.g., pass "4.3.0" to select exactly that version).
}

See \code{vignette("details")} for more information about these options.
