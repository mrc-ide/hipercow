# Submit a task

Submit a task to a queue. This is a lower-level function that you will
not often need to call. Typically a task will be submitted automatically
to your driver on creation (e.g., with
[`task_create_expr()`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/hipercow/reference/task_create_expr.md)),
unless you specified `driver = FALSE` or you had not yet configured a
driver.

## Usage

``` r
task_submit(id, ..., resources = NULL, driver = NULL, root = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- id:

  A vector of task ids

- ...:

  Disallowed additional arguments, don't use.

- resources:

  A list generated by `hipercow_resources` giving the cluster resource
  requirements to run your task.

- driver:

  The name of the driver to use, or you can leave blank if only one is
  configured (this will be typical).

- root:

  The hipercow root
